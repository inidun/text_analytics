    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a processing pipeline from computes word co-occurrences from plain text. The term-term co-occurrence matrix is transformed into a DTM corpus that has a vocabulary consisting of token-pairs. The co-occurring word trends can hence be xxplored using the ordinary word trends analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "For large corpora the processing time can be considerable and in such a case you\n",
    "should consider using the CLI-version of the processing pipeline.\n",

    "### How the co-occurrence counts are computed\n",
    "\n",
    "The co-occurrences are computed using a sliding window of size (D + 1 + D) that word by word moves through each document in the corpus, and keeps count of how many windows each pair of words co-occur in. Note that all windows will (currenty) always have an odd number of words, and the reason for this is the conditioned co-occurrence described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computation is done by first creating a (streamed) windowed corpus, consisting of all windows. From this corpus a DTM (document-term-matrix) is created, giving counts for each word in each window. This DTM is then used to compute a TTM (term-term-matrix) simply by multiplying the DTM with a transposed version of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the process of generating windows currently ignores sentences, paragraphs etc.\n",

To find instances matching \"information\" you could enter ```information*```, ```*information``` or ```*information*``` to match pairs starting with information, ending with information or containing information respectively.
